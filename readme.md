<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

GigaTrade is a Python script for monitoring trade messages in Path of Exile 2; it works by reading the game's 'Client.txt' text file for any new trade messages received in-game and alerting the user to ensure potential trades are not missed while tabbed out or AFK.

### Prerequisites

* Python

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from [Latest Releases](https://github.com/ImpliedThreat/GigaTrade-PoE2/releases)
2. Edit the 'settings.ini' file to include your Discord webhook URL and change the 'use_discord' option to 1 if you want to receive notifications via Discord.
3. Edit the 'settings.ini' file to include your 'Client.txt' file path, this is located in your Path of Exile 2 installation directory.
4. Run the included 'setup.bat' file to install the required Python libraries.
5. Run the 'run.bat' file to launch the script.
6. With your game running, keep the console window open to listen for new trade messages.
